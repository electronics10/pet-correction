## Introduction to MCGPU-PET
[MCGPU-PET](https://github.com/DIDSR/MCGPU-PET.git) is a research code; the authors likely developed it by extending NVIDIA CUDA sample programs. Therefore, CUDA samples dependencies such as `helper_functions.h` are essential but not shipped with the distribution. Moreover, since GPU binaries are architecture-specific (unlike x86-64 CPU binaries), distributing a prebuilt `.x` binary is impractical.

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DIDSR/MCGPU-PET.git
cd MCGPU-PET
```

The expected environment is Linux. To get the executive file `MCGPU-PET.x`, run
```bash
make
```
However, running `make` directly will likely fail due to the two issues above. If so, fix them as shown in the details.

<details>

1. **CUDA samples dependency**

Generally, find or install `helper_functions.h`:
```bash
# Option A: install via apt (replace version as needed)
sudo apt install cuda-samples-12-0

# Option B: clone NVIDIA's samples repo
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples.git
```
Then set `CUDA_SDK_PATH` in the `Makefile` to the `Common/inc` directory of whichever option you used.

Personally, I did
```bash
nvcc --version
# nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
# Copyright (c) 2005-2023 NVIDIA Corporation
# Built on Fri_Jan__6_16:45:21_PST_2023
# Cuda compilation tools, release 12.0, V12.0.140
# Build cuda_12.0.r12.0/compiler.32267302_0
```
Since the release is 12.0, I clone the CUDA samples by
```bash
# Clone the matching samples version to ~/cuda-samples
git clone --branch v12.0 https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples.git ~/cuda-samples
```

Then in `Makefile`, I changed the line:
```makefile
CUDA_SDK_PATH = $(HOME)/cuda-samples/Common/
```

2. **GPU compute capability**

Check your GPU's compute capability:
```bash
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=compute_cap --format=csv,noheader
```
Update `GPU_COMPUTE_CAPABILITY` in the `Makefile` accordingly, e.g. for capability 7.5:
```makefile
GPU_COMPUTE_CAPABILITY = -gencode=arch=compute_75,code=sm_75
```

(Personally, mine is the same as the authors so I don't need to change anything.)

Then compile:
```bash
make
```

(Compilation may succeeds with warnings, which are safe to ignore.)

### Usage

After you get the `MCGPU-PET.x` binary file, it becomes an independent executive binary file (which serves as a MC PET simulator). That is to say, you can deploy the file to any places/projects without any worries, it would work fine on your computer. Personally, I used it as a backend for my Python project. According to the authors, the simulator takes in a `.in` file (`MCGPU-PET.in` in sample example) and is typically used by prompting 
```bash
time ./MCGPU-PET.x MCGPU-PET.in | tee MCGPU-PET.out
```

Note that the `.in` file requires a `.vox` file (simulation object such as a phantom) and some `.gz` files (materials).
